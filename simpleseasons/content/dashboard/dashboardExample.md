Of the 10 states with at least 15 electoral votes, how many states did Donald Trump win? 7 .

Of the 13 states (including D.C. as a state) with fewer than 5 electoral votes, how many did Hillary Clinton win? 7.




Divide the number of electoral college votes in each state by the number of people who cast a vote in that state. In 2012, what state had the fewest electoral votes per voter? Most people assume the answer is California because the ratio of electoral votes to total population in lowest in California. However, the correct answer is Ohio. That is because Ohioans vote at a high rate. 

Maybe Ohioans are more likely than Californians to vote because Ohio is a swing state while California is very much not. Suppose voting was mandatory and every eligible voter cast a ballot. In 2012, what state would have had the fewest electoral votes per voter? The answer is no longer Ohio, but only because Pennsylvania is slightly lower.

If we consider the ratio of electoral votes to potential voters to be a measure of importance, then California is actually right in the middle of importance. If everyone voted, then 95 million people would be more important and 95 million would be less important.

In 2020, Florida will have 29 electoral votes and Wisconsin will have 10 electoral votes. In 2024, Florida is expected to have 31 electoral votes and Wisconsin will likely have 10 electoral votes. Imagine if a country, called FWWW, consisted solely of Florida and three copies of Wisconsin. Imagine that party F wins Florida by 1% each time and party W wins every Wisconsin by 1% each time. In 2020, party W wins with 30 electoral votes to 29 and in 2024 party F wins with 31 electoral votes to 30. Which party would win the popular vote of FWWW?

In the 2010 census Florida had a population of x, while Wisconsin had a population of y. By 2020, Florida had a population of xx, while Wisconsin had a population of yy. So Florida has >50% of the total population of FWWW. Since the two parties won by the same margins in all 4 states, one would expect that party F would win the popular vote of FWWW. 

However, in 2016 there were 3.07 million voters in Wisconsin and 8.58 million voters in Florida. Thus Florida only had 48.2% of the total voters and so it likely that party W would be complaining about the Electoral College in 2024 rather than party F complaining in 2020.

The small state advantage of the electoral college exists, but it can easily be overwhelming by other factors. In 2016, President Trump won the election with 56.3% of electoral votes despite winning only z% of the total popular vote. Removing 2 electoral votes from each state (and D.C.) represents a map that determines votes purely based on population. In 2016, President Trump won 56.2% of these popular electoral votes. 

In a close election, the Republican candidate will win about 30 states and the Democrat will win about 20 states + D.C. Thus Republican have a boost of 20 electoral votes. Any candidate that wins at least 280 electoral votes would almost certainly win without any small state advantage.

In 1876, The Republican won by one electoral vote despite losing the popular vote. Since Hayes won 21 states compared to 17 for Tilden, the small state advantage of 8 votes was a deciding factor.

In 1880, though, the Republican won the popular vote by 4.446 million to 4.442 million. He won the electoral college by 214 to 155, but won 19 states compared to 19 states. So his popular electoral vote was 176 to 117. He won so many states by narrow margins that he got 60% of the popular electoral vote.

Then in 1888, the Republican again won the electoral college without winning the popular vote. This time the margin was 65 votes and he only won 20 states compared to 18. So the size of the states did not matter.

1916 is odd. The Democrat won the popular vote 49.2% to 46.1% and won the electoral college 277 to 254. However, he won 30 states to 18 states which means the popular electoral vote would have been 218 to 217 in favor of the Republican. In this case the Democrat won the most number of votes and the most number of states, but could have lost the election because of winning by too much in certain states and losing narrowly in others.





His very narrow victories in Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania were much more important than his large victories in 3 vote states like Wyoming.

Many factors influence the electoral college.

The most important is the winner-take-all aspect really rewards candidates that win lots of states by close margins.

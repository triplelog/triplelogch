Most CEOs of large corporations are paid with a complicated set of salary, stock, options, and various bonuses. These complications are designed to give the CEO an incentive to perform well. However, those incentives are not perfectly aligned with the incentives of the owners. Imperfect incentives are worse than no incentive.

By setting predefined goals, the board has less ability to judge executives based on how their performance has actually helped the company. CEOs are incentivized to meet benchmarks and take risks that may cause great declines. 



CEOs and other executives may not respond to personal incentives but rather put the company's performance first. In that situation, why are CEOs offered incentives in the first place? Just pay them cash and common stock. Needlessly complicated goals only put the CEO at an advantage and make it easier to justify higher pay.

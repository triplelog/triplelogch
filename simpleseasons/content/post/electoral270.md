1.
Of the 10 most populated states, Donald Trump won 7 states and 152 electoral votes while Hillary Clinton won just 3 states and 104 electoral votes.

2.
Of the 13 states (treating D.C. as a state) with fewer than 5 electoral votes, Hillary Clinton won 7 states while Donald Trump won just 6 states.

3.
If every red state was combined into 1 state, Donald Trump would have won the electoral college by 248 votes to 232 despite losing the popular vote and losing 21 of the 22 states.

4.
In 2010, California had 22.9 million eligible voters while Michigan, Ohio, and Pennsylvania had a combined 25.4 million eligible voters. Despite 4 more Senate seats and 10% more eligible voters, the midwestern states only had 54 electoral votes to California's 55.

5.WIP-data good
In 2010, Texas had 15.5 million eligible voters compared to a combined 18.2 million in Pennsylvania and Ohio but the same number of the electoral votes. 

6.WIP
Texas and California are the two largest states, but they also have the largest shares of non-citizens and citizens under 18. Therefore Texas becoming a blue state does not necessarily guarantee that the electoral college will tip further towards Republicans.

7.WIP
In 2000, George W. Bush won 271 electoral votes. However, using 2000 census data would have awarded him 278 electoral votes. Had Al Gore won an extra 7,500 votes in New Hampshire he would have won the election thanks to outdated population data.

8.WIP-data good
In 2010, the 4 biggest states (CA, TX, FL, NY) had a combined 64.4 million eligible voters. The next 11 states had 67.1 million eligible voters. The smaller states had 5% more eligible voters and 14 more Senate seats, but both groups had 151 electoral votes.



9.WIP
Initially, 7? states did not use a popular vote to select a President so a system like the electoral college was necessary.

10.WIP
The electoral college was meant as a compromise between small states and large states. Small states would control the Senate, large states the House, and the President would split the difference. Today the Presidency is easier than the House.

11.WIP--
In 2016, Hillary Clinton needed to win 0.8% more votes to win the electoral college. She needed x% more to win a majority of congressional districts, and y% more to win a majority of states.

12.WIP
The electoral college was not designed to determine full control of the government.


In all, Donald Trump won 30 states compared to 20+D.C. for Hillary Clinton. Therefore Donald Trump won 60/102 of the Senate electoral votes. And, ignoring Maine,
232-306
190-246
Donald Trump won 56.4% of the House electoral vote.
Donald Trump won 58.8% of the Senate electoral vote.




## Eligible Voters

Non-citizens may not be able to vote, but the electoral college ensures that their neighbors get a bit of extra power to choose the President.

## Voter Turnout

Although voter turnout can be influenced by whether a state has a competitive Presidential vote, there are many other factors that impact voter turnout. And the electoral college protects states from losing power when turnout is low.



Different states have different turnout profiles. Massachusetts and _____ are heavily Democratic but with different turnouts.

## Swing States

The most obvious impact of the electoral college is the importance of swing states. This map of Presidential campaign stops makes it very clear that candidates know very well which voters have the most impact. There are diminishing returns to a campaign, but candidates return to the same states over and over in hopes of winning over just one more voter.

Voters in California really cannot have any impact by talking to neighbors or nearby friends. The most effective means of influencing the election then becomes trying to convince someone on the other side of the country. 

Counter-intuitively, localizing elections to a geographic region actually serves to nationalize elections. Money from California, New York, and Texas pours into Ohio and Pennsylvania. A national popular vote would likely reduce the number of advertisements that Californians would buy in Ohio.


## House Apportionment

1.WIP
The first veto in American history was George Washington demanding a different method of apportionment. The Jefferson method ended up being used instead and was used for decades.

2.WIP


Currently the law is very explicit that the House of Representatives should have 435 members apportioned based on population. However, actually apportioning those representatives is not as easy as dividing a state's population by some denominator. To make each state's delegation exactly proportional would mean fractional representatives. There has been significant debate about how to apportion.

This question is important for relative power of the House of Representatives, but the winner take all nature of the electoral college makes the question even more important in deciding the President. Even shifting a representative from Texas to California means shifting a rep that is 66% likely to be republican to a rep that is 66% likely to be a democrat. The net effect is about 1/3 of the net effect of shifting that electoral vote.

 

## Size of House of Representatives

1.WIP
The electoral college simply adds up the number of Senators and the number of Representatives. It is a crude method of balancing power. The relative power of small states versus large can fluctuate wildly depending on the size of the House. The size of the House does not change the relative power of small states in Congress.

2.WIP
What did the founding fathers intend? They wanted a representative for every 30,000 residents. However, they also lived in a country where that meant that Senators made up x% of Congress. Today, having one representative for every 30,000 residents would mean that Senators make up y% of Congress. In general, the question of the ideal size of the House should be independent of the question of how much relative power small states should have.

3.WIP
Increasing the size of the house would have benefits and drawbacks that have little to do with partisanship. However, the partisan impact on the electoral college can make such changes impossible.

Most presidents win a majority of states and a majority of representatives. Let's examine the years where there was a split between small states and large states.

4.WIP
Jimmy Carter is the only President not to win a majority of states? Also, Kennedy.

## Interesting Elections of the Past

# 1876

1.WIP
The 1876 election is the last election in which not every state chose its electors via a popular vote. The newly formed state of Colorado did not have enough time to have a popular vote so the state legislature took control.


If states are free to use whatever method of selection they want, the only decision is how to divy up the votes. Rutherford B. Hayes won by one electoral vote despite losing the popular vote by 3%. Since Hayes won 21 states compared to 17 for Tilden, the small state advantage of 8 votes was a deciding factor.

The vote was so compromised that ultimately the only way to avoid split governments was to let the Republican win the Presidency but appease southern Democrats by ending Reconstruction. Ultimately, this outcome was extremely beneficial to southern Democrats for more than 50 years. Republicans continued to win most Presidential elections, but Democrats had complete control of the South. 

In 1876, both candidates won about 90,000 votes in South Carolina. By 1924, Calvin Coolidge became President despite winning barely 1000 votes in South Carolina. His 2.21% of the vote remains the worst performance by any victor in any state. From 1904 through 1944, no Republican won a single county in the state or more than 8.54% of the state's vote.

However, the larger controversies regarded who won certain states. Just a decade removed from the Civil War, there were still significant hostilities. The 15th amendment had passed in 1870 and the North was protecting the rights of black men to vote. In South Carolina, more than 182,000 votes were cast despite estimates that the voting eligible population was less than that. At the time white supremicists were Democrats and the 60% of the population that was blacks were mostly Republican. Voter intimidation and other tricks were used. 


#1880
In 1880, though, the Republican won the popular vote by 4.446 million to 4.442 million. He won the electoral college by 214 to 155, but won 19 states compared to 19 states. So his popular electoral vote was 176 to 117. He won so many states by narrow margins that he got 60% of the popular electoral vote.

#1888
Then in 1888, the Republican again won the electoral college without winning the popular vote. This time the margin was 65 votes and he only won 20 states compared to 18. So the size of the states did not matter.


#1916

1916 is odd. The Democrat won the popular vote 49.2% to 46.1% and won the electoral college 277 to 254. However, he won 30 states to 18 states which means the popular electoral vote would have been 218 to 217 in favor of the Republican. In this case the Democrat won the most number of votes and the most number of states, but could have lost the election because of winning by too much in certain states and losing narrowly in others.

D won the popular vote, but did not win the house electoral college.


#1924

In the 1876 election, Democrats in South Carolina needed to stuff ballot boxes to make the election close. More than 90,000 votes were cast for each candidate, but Democrats could not stuff enough ballot boxes and eventually allowed the Republican to be declared the winner in exchange for the end of Reconstruction. The ensuing decades saw poll taxes, education requirements, and other measures to limit votes in ways that disproportionately impacted blacks. 

1.WIP
In 1924 only 50,000 votes were cast for President in South Carolina despite a population of more than 1.6 million. Only Nevada, with a population less than 100,000, recorded fewer votes. 4 states with just 3 electoral votes cast at least 75,000 votes while SC received 9 electoral votes.

2.WIP
In 1924, Calvin Coolidge became President despite winning just 1,123 votes (2.21%) in South Carolina. No state has ever been so opposed to the victor? Absolute? Percentage?

3.WIP
In 2016, there were 38,672 precincts with at least 500 votes cast that supported Donald Trump over Hillary Clinton. Of those precincts, none were as partisan as the entire state of South Carolina was in 1924.

4.WIP
South Carolina cast about .0017% of all votes in the nation, which is smaller than Wyoming's share of .0019% in 2016. Yet South Carolina was awarded .0169% of all electoral votes, so about 10 times. Wyoming was awarded .0056% of all electoral votes, so about 3 times.


South Carolina was free to limit the vote without any consequence. Of course, about 50% of the population was black and full voting rights could have changed everything. 



Despite the large number of electoral votes per vote, the state's extreme partisanship blunted its force as a decider of elections. Republicans did not campaign in South Carolina and did not support policies to help win the state because the chance of winning was just too low.

 

#2000

In 2000, the election was close enough that changing just about anything would have flipped the election.


#2016
His very narrow victories in Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania were much more important than his large victories in 3 vote states like Wyoming.

Many factors influence the electoral college.

The most important is the winner-take-all aspect really rewards candidates that win lots of states by close margins.

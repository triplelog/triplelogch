Most exit polls break down voters by age. Tables list how many voters under 30 voted for each candidate. Just as easily, tables could sort voters by year of birth. 


What is the difference? Both tables present the same exact information, but they lead to very different questions. Sorting by age leads to the question of why do younger people vote for Democrats and older people vote for Republicans? Sorting by year of birth leads to the question of why do people born in the 1980s vote for Democrats and people born in the 1960s vote for Republicans? The important difference is that younger people usually become older people while someone born in the 1980s will never become someone born in the 1960s.

Someone born in the 1960s might have blamed President Carter for the economy of the late 1970s and then been inspired by President Reagan to become a lifelong Republican. Someone born in the 1980s might blame President George W. Bush for the war in Iraq or the financial crisis and then been inspired by President Obama to become a lifelong Democrat. While many young people became lifelong Democrats during the 1980s or lifelong Republicans during the 2000s, the evidence so far suggests they are in the minority.

Most research suggests that year of birth is a much stronger indicator of partisanship than age. However, age does play an important role in voter turnout. As people get older they are more likely to vote.

From 1994 through 2004, every age group of white voters preferred Republicans by about the same amount. Starting in 2006 the youngest voters shifted to the left of other age groups. In 2018, the 30 to 44 year olds were to the left of voters 45 and older.

Why are we only analyzing white voters? Black, Latino, and Asian-American voters make up an increasing share of the younger electorate but do not have the same divide in terms of partisanship amongst different generations. Really, the point is to analyze non-black, non-Latino, non-Asian, etc. voters.

First we want the best possible data on how year of birth impacts partisanship. Using the Pew Research surveys.

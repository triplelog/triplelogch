What is the best way to balance the need to raise revenue with the desire to maximize economic growth? There are three main questions to consider: how much money to collect, who should pay, and when should they pay?

This post only worries about the third question regarding how much revenue should be collected this year versus future years. We will assume that the government needs to spend $x each year and each individual pays an appropriate share. What impact does a fluctuating tax rate have on economic growth?

# Lower Taxes = More Growth

We assume that when the tax rate is 0%, the total economic output is $100. When the tax rate is 100%, the total economic output is $0. As the tax rate increases from 0% to 100%, the total economic output decreases the entire way. Everything else about how quickly or slowly that decrease occurs is unknown.

Use Konva to drag/drop bezier curve.

Spending $x per year either means collecting $x in tax revenue or borrowing some of that amount and paying more than $x at some point in the future. The question we are after is whether fluctuating tax rates affect economic growth.



The reasoning is that lower tax rates force future politicians to cut spending to allow permanent tax decreases.

Of the 10 states with at least 15 electoral votes, how many states did Donald Trump win? 7 .

Of the 13 states (including D.C. as a state) with fewer than 5 electoral votes, how many did Hillary Clinton win? 7.


If every red state was combined into 1 state, Donald Trump would have won the electoral college by 248 votes to 232 despite losing the popular vote and losing 21 of the 22 states. That is not to suggest that the electoral college does not favor small states that vote Republican, but that benefit is capped.

The founding fathers had to develop some sort of system like the electoral college because many states did not plan to let voters select a President. A national popular vote was impossible when fewer than half of the states wanted a popular vote. The electoral vote can deviate from the popular vote for many reasons.


In all, Donald Trump won 30 states compared to 20+D.C. for Hillary Clinton. Therefore Donald Trump won 60/102 of the Senate electoral votes. And, ignoring Maine,
232-306
190-246
Donald Trump won 56.4% of the House electoral vote.
Donald Trump won 58.8% of the Senate electoral vote.


















Divide the number of electoral college votes in each state by the number of people who cast a vote in that state. In 2012, what state had the fewest electoral votes per voter? Most people assume the answer is California because the ratio of electoral votes to total population in lowest in California. However, the correct answer is Ohio. That is because Ohioans vote at a high rate. 

Maybe Ohioans are more likely than Californians to vote because Ohio is a swing state while California is very much not. Suppose voting was mandatory and every eligible voter cast a ballot. In 2012, what state would have had the fewest electoral votes per voter? The answer is no longer Ohio, but only because Pennsylvania is slightly lower.

If we consider the ratio of electoral votes to potential voters to be a measure of importance, then California is actually right in the middle of importance. If everyone voted, then 95 million people would be more important and 95 million would be less important.

In 2020, Florida will have 29 electoral votes and Wisconsin will have 10 electoral votes. In 2024, Florida is expected to have 31 electoral votes and Wisconsin will likely have 10 electoral votes. Imagine if a country, called FWWW, consisted solely of Florida and three copies of Wisconsin. Imagine that party F wins Florida by 1% each time and party W wins every Wisconsin by 1% each time. In 2020, party W wins with 30 electoral votes to 29 and in 2024 party F wins with 31 electoral votes to 30. Which party would win the popular vote of FWWW?

In the 2010 census Florida had a population of x, while Wisconsin had a population of y. By 2020, Florida had a population of xx, while Wisconsin had a population of yy. So Florida has >50% of the total population of FWWW. Since the two parties won by the same margins in all 4 states, one would expect that party F would win the popular vote of FWWW. 

However, in 2016 there were 3.07 million voters in Wisconsin and 8.58 million voters in Florida. Thus Florida only had 48.2% of the total voters and so it likely that party W would be complaining about the Electoral College in 2024 rather than party F complaining in 2020.

The small state advantage of the electoral college exists, but it can easily be overwhelming by other factors. In 2016, President Trump won the election with 56.3% of electoral votes despite winning only z% of the total popular vote. Removing 2 electoral votes from each state (and D.C.) represents a map that determines votes purely based on population. In 2016, President Trump won 56.2% of these popular electoral votes. 

In a close election, the Republican candidate will win about 30 states and the Democrat will win about 20 states + D.C. Thus Republican have a boost of 20 electoral votes. Any candidate that wins at least 280 electoral votes would almost certainly win without any small state advantage.

## Interesting Elections of the Past

# 1876

The 1876 election is the last election in which not every state choose its electors via a popular vote. The newly formed state of Colorado claimed there wasn't enough time to have a popular vote so the state legislature took control. This decision was not particularly controversial since many states in the past had avoided a popular vote. 

If states are free to use whatever method of selection they want, the only decision is how to divy up the votes. Rutherford B. Hayes won by one electoral vote despite losing the popular vote by 3%. Since Hayes won 21 states compared to 17 for Tilden, the small state advantage of 8 votes was a deciding factor.

The vote was so compromised that ultimately the only way to avoid split governments was to let the Republican win the Presidency but appease southern Democrats by ending Reconstruction. Ultimately, this outcome was extremely beneficial to southern Democrats for more than 50 years. Republicans continued to win most Presidential elections, but Democrats had complete control of the South. 

In 1876, both candidates won about 90,000 votes in South Carolina. By 1924, Calvin Coolidge became President despite winning barely 1000 votes in South Carolina. His 2.21% of the vote remains the worst performance by any victor in any state. From 1904 through 1944, no Republican won a single county in the state or more than 8.54% of the state's vote.

However, the larger controversies regarded who won certain states. Just a decade removed from the Civil War, there were still significant hostilities. The 15th amendment had passed in 1870 and the North was protecting the rights of black men to vote. In South Carolina, more than 182,000 votes were cast despite estimates that the voting eligible population was less than that. At the time white supremicists were Democrats and the 60% of the population that was blacks were mostly Republican. Voter intimidation and other tricks were used. 





#1916

1916 is odd. The Democrat won the popular vote 49.2% to 46.1% and won the electoral college 277 to 254. However, he won 30 states to 18 states which means the popular electoral vote would have been 218 to 217 in favor of the Republican. In this case the Democrat won the most number of votes and the most number of states, but could have lost the election because of winning by too much in certain states and losing narrowly in others.

D won the popular vote, but did not win the house electoral college.


#1924

In the 1876 election, Democrats in South Carolina needed to stuff ballot boxes to make the election close. More than 90,000 votes were cast for each candidate, but Democrats could not stuff enough ballot boxes and eventually allowed the Republican to be declared the winner in exchange for the end of Reconstruction. The ensuing decades saw poll taxes, education requirements, and other measures to limit votes in ways that disproportionately impacted blacks. 

The result was that in 1924 only 50,000 votes were cast in South Carolina. Calvin Coolidge became President despite winning just 1,123 votes (2.21%) in South Carolina. No state has ever been so opposed to the victor. Despite only casting about 50,000 votes, the state received 9 electoral votes due to its population of more than 1.6 million. 

Only Nevada, with a population of less than 100,000, recorded fewer votes. The other 4 states with just 3 electoral votes all cast at least 75,000 votes. South Carolina was free to limit the vote without any consequence. Of course, about 50% of the population was black and full voting rights could have changed everything. 

South Carolina cast about .0017% of all votes in the nation, which is smaller than Wyoming's share of .0019% in 2016. Yet South Carolina was awarded .0169% of all electoral votes, so about 10 times. Wyoming was awarded .0056% of all electoral votes, so about 3 times.

Despite the large number of electoral votes per vote, the state's extreme partisanship blunted its force as a decider of elections. Republicans did not campaign in South Carolina and did not support policies to help win the state because the chance of winning was just too low.

In 2016, there were 38,672 precincts with at least 500 votes cast that supported Donald Trump over Hillary Clinton. Of those precincts, none were as partisan as the entire state of South Carolina was in 1924. 

#2000

In 2000, the election was close enough that changing just about anything would have flipped the election.



His very narrow victories in Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania were much more important than his large victories in 3 vote states like Wyoming.

Many factors influence the electoral college.

The most important is the winner-take-all aspect really rewards candidates that win lots of states by close margins.

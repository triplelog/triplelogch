Capital gains taxes are taxes paid as a percentage of the increase in a stock (or other investment) price. This income is taxed at a rate that is less than the rate that labor income is taxed. Several methods exist to defer or never pay the capital gains tax. Why are capital gains given favorable treatment?

The two main arguments to offer a lower capital gains rate are that taxing capital gains represents double taxation and that a lower tax rate increases capital investment.

# Double Taxation

If I invested $100 in a stock yesterday that has increased to $110 today then I have made a profit of $10. If inflation was 10% over this time period then the $100 invested yesterday was really worth $110 in today's dollar for a real profit of $0 in today's dollar.

Should I pay taxes as if I made $0 or $10? Suppose I earned $120 from my labors yesterday, was taxed $20 and had $100 left. If my money is still worth the same amount today, then taxing any of that amount seems like double taxation because I have already been taxed on that $100 from yesterday. However, taxes and inflation affect everyone in the market.

If everyone knew yesterday that inflation would be 10% and the tax rate would be x%, how would that change the market? Suppose a stock promises a dividend of $110 today and then is set to close and never pay another cent. How much should I have paid for that stock yesterday? Paying $100 provides a good nominal return, but the pretax real return is 0%.

If the capital gains rate was 10% then the after tax real return would be -1/110. In a competitive marketplace the price would decrease to around $99. Then the after tax real return would be about 0%.

If the capital gains rate was 20% then the after tax real return would be -2/110. In a competitive marketplace the price would decrease to around $98. Then the after tax real return would be about 0%.

Investments that would be break even if I did not have to pay taxes are bad investments. There are a lot of investments that seem good if I did not have to pay taxes, but it is not taxes that make them bad. Taxes simply end up being blamed because they are the last expense. 

Willson Contrares made a play that would have been good in the particular scenario where the runner had to follow the new rules but the catcher did not. Under the old rules the runner would have been safe. Under the new rules the runner was safe. The only difference is that under the new rules the umpire takes the blame.

Similarly there are investments that are bad regardless of the tax rates, but only when tax rates are high do those taxes get blamed.


# Capital Investment

Yes people are influenced by tax rates. But a lower rate on capital gains income than labor income suggests that wasted capital is a larger concern than wasted labor. People can choose not to work if tax rates are too high. But if capital gains taxes are too high, people are less likely to not invest their money. Doing nothing will lead to less after tax income with little benefit. Investing in an index fund takes no time.


# Capital Gains Breaks

After death, investments reset their cost basis. That means that buying a stock at the age of 20 and holding until death at the age of 80 will lead to no capital gains taxes on the likely significant profit. Selling that stock at the age of 50 and buying a different stock generally causes a tax bill. Therefore, holding onto stocks that are bad investments can be the smart play because of the tax implications.

Capital allocation is not ideal.

The 529 education savings accounts also generate a capital gains break. A parent who can afford to fully fund a college fund when their child is born will likely give their child a significant leg up on children who do not have parents that can set aside such a sum. Allowing such intergenerational transfer of privilege is important because it can motivate talented people to work hard even after they do not need the money for themselves.

The government needs to be careful about punishing such transfers, but exacerbating the differences is problematic. Not only do such children get the advantage of a college fund, but they end up with more money than the free market would have provided.

President Reagan wanted a tax code that provided the smallest possible disruption of the natural economy. However, having various breaks causes millions of people to make decisions based on tax implications. Removing loopholes and deferments allows everyone to make decisions on the same as if no taxes existed.

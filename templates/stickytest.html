		<p>Programming in CSS is incredibly limiting. Javascript and other scripting languages allow a developer to do anything they want. Knowing how everything in a program is unnecessary. Reaching for the best way is unnecessary. Creativity is unnecessary.</p>

		<p>Resizing</p>
		<p>CSS stands for cascading style sheets, and the cascading nature of the language makes "programming" incredibly difficult. Information can usually only pass in one direction: down to an element's children and later siblings.</p>
		<p>CSS has no memory. Each bit of information requires a checkbox. </p>

		<p>Why are computers so good at math? Memory, reliability, and speed. If you want to teach a computer how to do math then it makes sense to take advantage of these skills. Why limit yourself to the weaknesses of humans who make errors, have limited memory, and can only do a few operations each minute? </p>
		<p>If the goal is actually to teach humans how to do math, then creating a computer that emulates humans (errors and all) as closely as possible is ideal. Why are humans so good at math? Patterns.</p>
		<p>Teaching a computer to identify the most important part of a complex expression is not a simple task.</p>

"But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and praising pain was born and I will give you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure?"

Et harum quidem rerum facilis est et expedita distinctio.

"At vero eos et accusamus et iusto odio dignissimos ducimus qui blanditiis praesentium voluptatum deleniti atque corrupti quos dolores et quas molestias excepturi sint occaecati cupiditate non provident, similique sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollitia animi, id est laborum et dolorum fuga. Et harum quidem rerum facilis est et expedita distinctio. Nam libero tempore, cum soluta nobis est eligendi optio cumque nihil impedit quo minus id quod maxime placeat facere possimus, omnis voluptas assumenda est, omnis dolor repellendus.

<p>1914 translation by H. Rackham
"On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men who are so beguiled and demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee the pain and trouble that are bound to ensue; and equal blame belongs to those who fail in their duty through weakness of will, which is the same as saying through shrinking from toil and pain. These cases are perfectly simple and easy to distinguish. In a free hour, when our power of choice is untrammelled and when nothing prevents our being able to do what we like best, every pleasure is to be welcomed and every pain avoided. But in certain circumstances and owing to the claims of duty or the obligations of business it will frequently occur that pleasures have to be repudiated and annoyances accepted. The wise man therefore always holds in these matters to this principle of selection: he rejects pleasures to secure other greater pleasures, or else he endures pains to avoid worse pains."
